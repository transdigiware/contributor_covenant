We're always looking for new localizations of Contributor Covenant and are thankful to the volunteers who spend their time on this effort.

Instructions for translators can be found [here](https://github.com/EthicalSource/contributor_covenant#translating).

Contributor Covenant uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/)
for revisions so all URLs are permanent.
